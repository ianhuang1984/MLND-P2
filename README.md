Analyze the dataset on students' performance and develop a model that will predict the likelihood that a given student will pass.
Find the most effective model that uses the least amount of computation costs to save on the budget. The objective is to analyze the dataset on students' performance and develop a model that will predict the likelihood whether a given student will pass and thus quantifying whether an intervention is necessary.

1. Classification vs Regression
2. Exploring the Data
3. Preparing the Data
4. Training and Evaluating Models: Choose 3 supervised learning models(Gaussian Naive Bayes/ Decision Tree/ Support Vector Machine) and measure the F1 score and resources each taken to predict.
5. Choosing the Best Model: Based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance, choose the model that is generally the most appropriate. Fine-tune the model using GridSearch.
